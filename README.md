## Story Line

Due to a twist of fate, you developed chronic "Anemia", a condition that results in the amount of Red Blood Cells in your body to decrease over time. This leads to reduced oxygen delivery to various parts of your body, causing you to feel fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. You have to forgo exercising and your body has started to deteriorate with this medical condition.

As a determined person that leads an active lifestyle, you CANNOT forgo exercising and just let your body die! So, you prayed to the Red Blood Cells God, "Red Blood Cells God, please stop my Anemia condition... I will do anything in order to survive and keep exercising... Please... Pleas..."

Bzz... Bzzzzz.... Congratulations! The Red Blood Cell God has decided to grant you a special power – The power to transform from a "Human" into a "Red Blood Cell"!

With this special power, you can assist your body's Red Blood Cells (NPCs) in transporting oxygen from the lungs to various parts of the body to keep the body alive! As a special Red Blood Cell, you can transport more oxygen than Red Blood Cells NPCs and keep the body alive with your efforts!
Your Goal? Use your new powers to keep your body alive while engaging in various human physical exercises!

### [Scaling Space] The 2 Game Modes – Human Mode & Red Blood Cell Mode

The LifeLine VR sets the scene in 2 different game modes – Human mode, and Red Blood Cell mode. Both modes are in first person perspective and have different scales – Human mode in the human world scale while the Red Blood Cell mode is in the microscopic scale. The player can switch between the Human mode and the Red Blood Cell mode anytime they want as they play the game.

### [Scaling Time] Decrease of Red Blood Cells Over Time

As the player plays the game in either game modes, the percentage of red blood cells in the body will decrease gradually, with major spikes in the amount decreased every 14 mins. Each playtime minute equals 10 real-world days. Players will need to source for blood packs to maintain a safe level of red blood cells in the body.

### Player’s Goal

The player’s goal in the game is to survive while doing different activities in the Human mode that affects the body’s oxygen demand, and switching to the Red Blood Cell mode to increase the oxygen levels in the various body parts by transporting oxygen themselves. Ultimately, the player should keep their red blood cells levels and oxygen levels above 0 throughout the game.
